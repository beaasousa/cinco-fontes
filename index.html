  <h1> As cinco fontes, estrelando: Linkin Park!</h1>  

    <h2 class="serifa">Fonte Com Serifa</h2>
    <p class="se">Peep the style and the kids checking for it
        The number one question is how could you ignore it
        We drop right back in the cut
        Over basement tracks
        With raps that got you backing this up like</p>

    <h2 class="normal">Fonte Sem Serifa</h2>
    <p class="nor">Rewind that we're just rolling with the rhythm
        Rise from the ashes of stylistic division
        With these non-stop lyrics of life living
        Not to be forgotten, but still unforgiven
        But, in the meantime, there are those
        Who wanna talk this and that
        So I suppose that it gets to
        At that point feelings gotta get hurt
        And get dirty with the people spreading the dirty goes</p>

    <h2 class="fantasia">Fonte Fantasia</h2>
    <p class="fan">Try to give you warning
        But everyone ignores me
        Told you everything loud and clear
        But nobody's listening
        Call to you so clearly
        But you don't want to hear me
        Told you everything loud and clear
        But nobody's listening</p>

    <h2 class="cursiva">Fonte Cursiva</h2>
     <p class="cur">I got a heart full of pain
        Head full of stress
        Hand full of anger
        Held in my chest
        And everything left is a waste of time
        I hate my rhymes
        But hate everyone else's more
        I'm riding on the back of this pressure
        Guessing that it's better
        That I can't keep myself together
        Because all of this stress
        Gave me something to write on
        The pain gave me something I could set my sights on
        You never forget the blood, sweat and tears
        The uphill struggle over years
        The fear and trash talking
        And the people it was to
        And the people that started it just like you</p>

    <h2 class="monoespaço">Fonte Monoespaçada</h2>
        <p class="mon">I got a
        Heart full of pain
        Head full of stress
        Hand full of anger
        Held in my chest
        Uphill struggle
        Blood, sweat and tears
        Nothing to gain, everything to fear</p>
